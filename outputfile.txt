okay so how does this relate to generating small text well as it turned out there were a bunch of people that werent too interestedinunicode they had specific character requirements that unicode hadnt accounted for in their initial specification so in order to getprogrammers and organisations to adopt the unicode standard faster unicode began incorperating a bunch of weird symbols and rules that those people needed for their applications and thus unicodes full character set exploded to include include tens of thousands of differentsymbols for many languages and many arcane legacy systemsalong the way it picked up a set of symbols which can be used to emulate small caps an alphabet of small capital letters and a somewhatincomplete set of subscript and superscript characters so the small text letters that you see in the output box above are just a few ofthe symbols that are specified in the unicode standard  just like the symbols that youre reading right now so while you might have thought that you were looking for small text fonts it turns out that youre actually looking for small text symbolsor characters people just assume it must be a font because they look different to normal characters  but so do emojis and theyre not a font  theyre also characters in the unicode standard and thats pretty cool because it means you can copy and paste the small text that this site generates into your instagram bio twitter posts discord messages tumblr blog posts youtube comments and just about anywhere else
